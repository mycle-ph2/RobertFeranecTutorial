# RobertFeranacTutorial

## Summary
My first schematic and Printed Circuit Board (Assembly) 
Designed in KiCad.
This schematic was based on the tutorial by Robert Feranec: [video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maaBkw7IRUc)

## The Purpose of This Assembly 
* This assembly connects an LED which can be connected to for example an Arduino UNO.
* This assembly introduces concepts like layers and component connections in PCB Design.
* This project gives practice in saving files, including information about the schematic, BOM, footprint positions, and more.

## Components List
* Resistor
* Diode
* J1 Connector
* 3.3V Power Source

## Things I learned
* Create a custom symbol for a component
* Find existing components from a library
* Attach a Footprint to a Component Symbol
* Work with different layers in the PCB Design, including Cu, Edge, FAB, Silkscreen, and more.
* View a 3D Model
* Run DRC Check and resolve errors
